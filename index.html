<!-- QUESTION 1: SCATTER PLOT -->
<div>
<h3>Question 1: Relationship between duration of pit stop and lap time</h3>

<div id="q1"></div>
    <h4>Plot:</h4>
    <div id="q1_plot" class="center_plot"></div>
    <br>
    <p>
        <li>Color scheme: Formula 1 Official Logo Color scheme</li>
        <li>Marks and channels</li>
        <li>x axis: Lap time in millisecond</li>
        <li>y axis: Pit stop time in millisecond</li>
        <br>
        The correlation between the duration of pit stops and lap times in Formula 1 is a critical aspect of the race strategy.<br>
        Pit stops are an essential part of the race, as they allow teams to change tires, refuel, and make necessary repairs to the car.<br>
        However, a longer pit stop can result in a significant loss of time on the track, which can ultimately impact a driver's overall race performance.<br>
        <br>
        Based on the given results, we can see that most drivers' pit stop times are in the range of 18000 to 40000 milliseconds, indicating that teams are generally efficient in completing their pit stops within this range. <br>
        Additionally, we can see that drivers' lap times vary widely, ranging from 58000 to 260000 milliseconds.<br> 
        <br>
        Overall, the relationship between pit stop duration and lap time is complex and multifaceted, and there are many factors that can impact this correlation, such as the type of tire used, the fuel load, and the driver's skill level. <br>
        However, by analyzing the data provided, we can begin to understand the importance of efficient pit stops in maximizing a driver's performance on the track.<br>
